  <b>Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?</b><br>
  Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their patrons. I was tasked with xamining Artemis Financial’s web-based software application to identify any security vulnerabilities in their current software.

  <b>What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?</b><br>
   I think I was strongest at coming up with solutions to the dependency check report. It is important to code securely for many reasons. The most important reason is that it can help prevent attacks from happening in the first place. Most attacks exploit a vulnerability in the code. By minimizing possible vulnerabilities, a company can greatly reduce the chance of a security breach.
   </p>
   <p>
  <b>What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?</b><br>
  I found the most challenging part of working through the vulnerability assessment to be finding solutions to the vulnerabilties found in the dependency check. It was tedious to go through each vulnerability. Also, each vulnerability had many sources with possible solutions, so it was difficult to sift through the information to find the proper solution.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?</b><br>
  I approached the need to increase layers of security in the Manual Review section of the Vulnerability Assessment Report. Mainly, I mentioned that there needs to be an authentication/authorization system in place. Another layer should be input validation on variables.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities</b><br>
  I made sure that the code and application were functional and secure by first doing a manual review. I then refactored any code that was questionable. In order to make sure I didn't introduce any new vulnerabilities I ran a dependency-check.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?</b><br>
  The OWASP Maven dependency-check plugin was definitely the tool that I found the most useful. I also found the National Vulnerability Database to be helpful, and will use it when working on future assignments.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?</b><br>
  I would want to showcase my knowledge of building a secure Maven project, and how to check dependencies for vulnerability. I would also want to showcase my knowledge of authentication/authorization, hash functions, and encryption.
