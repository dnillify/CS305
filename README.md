  <b>Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?</b><br>
  Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their patrons. I was tasked with xamining Artemis Financial’s web-based software application to identify any security vulnerabilities in their current software.

  <b>What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?</b><br>
   I think I was strongest at coming up with solutions to the dependency check report. It is important to code securely for many reasons. The most important reason is that it can help prevent attacks from happening in the first place. Most attacks exploit a vulnerability in the code. By minimizing possible vulnerabilities, a company can greatly reduce the chance of a security breach.

  <b>What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?</b><br>
  I found the most challenging part of working through the vulnerability assessment to be finding solutions to the vulnerabilties found in the dependency check. It was tedious to go through each vulnerability. Also, each vulnerability had many sources with possible solutions, so it was difficult to sift through the information to find the proper solution.<br>

  <b>How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?</b><br>
  I approached the need to increase layers of security in the Manual Review section of the Vulnerability Assessment Report.
